        case .ğŸ”µ:
            return "You are generally a calm person. You tend to avoid being the center of attention, but somehow find yourself being the defacto leader of your social group in any given situation. If you have one weakness, its that you struggle to ask for help when you need it. But your biggest strength is your kindness!"
        case .ğŸŸ¡:
            return "You are a bright and cheerful person! You try your best to keep upbeat and positive as much as possible, and this draws people to you. If you have one weakness, its that you get the blues fast when you can't find a positive to focus on. But your biggest strength is you resilience!"
        case .ğŸ©µ:
            return "You are a kind, but introverted person. You tend to make friends fairly easily (you have no idea how), but enjoy your \"You Time\". If you have one weakness, its that you tend to think of the worst outcome in any situation. But your biggest strength is the close bonds you've built with the people who love you!"
        case .ğŸ©·:
            return "You are a carefree and adventerous person. You make friends fast, and enemies just as fast - you tend to hold a grudge! If you have one weakness, its that you tend to let your imagination run wild. But your biggest strength is your cleverness!"
