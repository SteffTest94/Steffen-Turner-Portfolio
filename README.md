This repisitroy is meant to be a portfolio for work done while gaining my AAS degree in Cloud Computing and Application Development, as well as any relevant future projects as my career develops. Some academic projects were turned in for a grade, rather than because I thought them wholly complete, and may continue to be worked on over time.

****Webpages Section****

This section of the portfolio is for the webpages created from 2024, from various assignments. Each of the pages can be viewed by downloading the files, and opening the relevant index file by choice. As of 12/15/2024, the original repisotories for these webpages can be found at https://github.com/SteffTest94?tab=repositories; I have the intention to consolodate these webpages into one project at a later date.

****XCode Applications (13) Section****

This section of the portfolio is for applications created with Xcode 13. These applications were made while learning Swift and XCode 13, for the Swift Associate and Swift Certified User exams. As of 12/22/24, all files in this section must be opened in Xcode or a program capable of running Xcode for full functionality.
