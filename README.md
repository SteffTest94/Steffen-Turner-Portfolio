This repisitroy is meant to be a portfolio for work done while gaining my AAS degree in Cloud Computing and Application Development, as well as any relevant future projects as my career develops. Some academic projects were turned in for a grade, rather than because I thought them wholly complete, and may continue to be worked on over time.

****Webpages Section****

This section of the portfolio is for the webpages created from 2024, from various assignments. Each of the pages can be viewed by downloading the files, and opening the relevant index file by choice. As of 12/15/2024, the original repisotories for these webpages can be found at https://github.com/SteffTest94?tab=repositories; I have the intention to consolodate these webpages into one project at a later date.

****XCode Applications (13) Section****

This section of the portfolio is for applications created with Xcode 13. These applications were made while learning Swift and XCode 13, for the Swift Associate and Swift Certified User exams. As of 12/22/24, all files in this section must be opened in Xcode or a program capable of running Xcode for full functionality. 

****Java Script Web Apps Section****

This section of the portfolio is for web applications made with Java Script that are not attatched to fullstack services like AWS. They were originally created for function over form, and may be worked upon in the furture for better visual congruity.

****Branches****
New branches will be added based on the year work started. It will follow the format YYYYBranch.V.SV where YYYY = year that the branch started, V = version based on a single project being updated/created, and SV = subversion based on the session. For example, if I work on the first file of the 2026work for 2 hours, the branch commit would be 2026work.1.1 and if I work on it again later that same day for one hours, the comit would be 2026.1.2. The main branch will be updated without version info.
